**API Endpoint:** https://alphastack-discovery.onrender.com/signals/top
**Total Recommendations:** 20 stocks

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Grade: B- (75/100)**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
1. ✅ **Zero penny stocks** - All recommendations $5+ (MIN_PRICE filter working)
2. ✅ **RVOL in range** - All stocks showing RVOL 1.6x - 2.0x (stealth window)

### ❌ **Critical Issues:**
1. ❌ **Frontend NOT displaying RVOL** - TypeScript interface missing field (FIXED in this commit)
2. ❌ **Generic web enrichment** - All stocks showing identical "Moderately bullish" sentiment
3. ❌ **Missing market cap data** - All `market_cap: null` (enrichment pipeline issue)
4. ⚠️ **Some questionable picks** - MQ ($5.36) below $5 threshold in image but API shows valid data

## 🔬 TECHNICAL VALIDATION

### **RVOL Distribution Analysis:**
```
1.99-2.00x (Perfect Stealth): 3 stocks (DAWN, MBC, VIPS)
1.90-1.98x (Excellent):      6 stocks (AXL, BKD, BGC, TRIP, AVPT)
1.78-1.87x (Good):           5 stocks (FIGS, ESRT, FSK, LBTYA, SGHC)
1.62-1.72x (Borderline):     6 stocks (MQ, GPRK, MFG, LEG, EC, MLCO, TDUP)
```

**✅ VALIDATION:** All stocks in 1.5-2.0x range (stealth window working)

### **Price Stability Analysis:**
```
<0.5% change (Perfect):   6 stocks (BKD, ESRT, FIGS, MQ, MBC, VIPS, TRIP)
0.5-1.0% change (Good):   9 stocks (DAWN, AXL, GPRK, MFG, LEG, EC, MLCO, TDUP, FSK)
>1.0% change (Borderline): 5 stocks (SGHC, LBTYA, EC, TDUP, TRIP)
```

**✅ VALIDATION:** 75% of stocks showing <1% change (true stealth)

### **Explosion Probability Analysis:**
```
80-90% (High):    4 stocks (DAWN, AXL, BKD, ESRT)
70-79% (Medium):  8 stocks (FIGS, MQ, AVPT, LEG, EC, SGHC, GPRK, MLCO)
60-69% (Lower):   8 stocks (BGC, FSK, TRIP, VIPS, LBTYA, TDUP, others)
```

**⚠️ CONCERN:** Wide explosion probability range suggests model uncertainty

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **Issue #1: Frontend RVOL Display (CRITICAL)**
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED IN THIS COMMIT**

**Problem:** TypeScript interface missing `rvol` field, causing frontend to show "Above-average volume" instead of specific RVOL multipliers.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// types/trading.ts - Line 9
rvol: number;  // CRITICAL: Relative Volume (most important metric)

// services/DiscoveryService.ts - Line 42
rvol: parseFloat(stock.rvol || 1.0), // Preserve RVOL for display
```

**Expected Result After Deployment:**
- Frontend will show "🚀 1.99x volume surge" instead of "Above-average volume"
- RVOL badge will display prominently in green
- Users can validate stealth detection quality

---

### **Issue #2: Generic Web Enrichment (MEDIUM)**
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

**Problem:** All stocks showing identical sentiment:
```json
"web_sentiment_score": 45.0,
"web_sentiment_description": "Moderately bullish sentiment with above-average interest",
"institutional_activity": "Emerging institutional attention"
```

**Root Cause:** Web enrichment may be using template responses instead of real web scraping.

**Recommendation:**
- Verify Perplexity API integration
- Check if `WEB_ENRICHMENT` flag is actually calling external API
- May need to increase `WEB_ENRICHMENT_LIMIT` from 8 to 20 for full coverage

---

### **Issue #3: Missing Market Cap Data (LOW)**
**Status:** ⚠️ **INFORMATIONAL**

**Problem:** All stocks showing `market_cap: null`

**Impact:** Low - Market cap not critical for stealth detection, but nice-to-have for risk assessment

**Recommendation:** Premium data enrichment may be timing out. Consider increasing timeout threshold.
