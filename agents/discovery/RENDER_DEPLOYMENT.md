# 🚀 Render Deployment Guide for Enhanced Discovery System

## 🎯 System Overview

The enhanced Discovery System now includes:
- ✅ **Robust MCP Detection** - Works in both local and deployed environments
- ✅ **Multiple Function Call Methods** - Graceful fallback between MCP and HTTP
- ✅ **Real Short Interest Data** - Enhanced with Polygon monthly data
- ✅ **Enhanced Scoring System** - 35% weight for short squeeze potential
- ✅ **Production-Ready APIs** - Health checks, metrics, and error handling

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables Required
Set these in your Render dashboard:

```env
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Optional
PORT=8000  # Auto-provided by Render
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 2. Service Configuration
```yaml
# Use the provided render.yaml configuration
Service Type: Web Service
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: python3 discovery_api.py
Health Check Path: /health
```

## 🔧 MCP Integration Details

### How MCP Detection Works in Render:

1. **Multiple Detection Methods:**
   - `globals()` - Works in Claude Code environment
   - `eval()` - Works in Render deployment environment
   - `hasattr(module)` - Fallback for module-level injection
   - `builtins` - Fallback for builtin injection

2. **Function Call Routing:**
   ```python
   # The system automatically chooses the right method:
   snapshot_response = _call_mcp_function(
       'mcp__polygon__get_snapshot_all',
       market_type="stocks"
   )
   ```

3. **Graceful Fallback:**
   - If MCP functions are available → Enhanced mode with real-time data
   - If MCP functions are not available → HTTP API fallback
   - System never fails, always provides results

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect Repository
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Select the `agents/discovery` folder as the build context

### Step 2: Configure Service
1. Set service name: `alphastack-discovery`
2. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set start command: `python3 discovery_api.py`
4. Set health check path: `/health`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
1. Go to Environment tab in Render dashboard
2. Add `POLYGON_API_KEY` with your API key
3. Optionally add other environment variables

### Step 4: Deploy & Monitor
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Monitor deployment logs
3. Check `/health` endpoint for system status
4. Check `/metrics` endpoint for performance

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
# Returns system status and dependency health
```

### Discovery Scan
```bash
POST /discover
# Runs full discovery pipeline
# Returns: scan_id, candidates, and metadata
```

### Top Signals
```bash
GET /signals/top
# Gets current top discovery signals
# Returns: formatted results for frontend
```

### Metrics
```bash
GET /metrics
# Returns API performance metrics
# Includes: request counts, response times, system status
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### With MCP Functions Available:
- ✅ Enhanced real-time data access
- ✅ Short interest enrichment via MCP
- ✅ Ticker details via MCP
- ✅ Faster, more accurate results

### Without MCP Functions (Fallback):
- ✅ HTTP API data access
- ✅ Full discovery pipeline still works
- ✅ All features available
- ⚡ Slightly slower due to HTTP requests

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If MCP Functions Don't Work:
1. Check logs for "MCP Polygon functions detected"
2. If not detected, system will use HTTP fallback
3. Verify POLYGON_API_KEY is set correctly
4. Check `/health` endpoint for detailed status

### Common Issues:
- **503 Service Unavailable** → Check POLYGON_API_KEY
- **Rate Limiting** → System has built-in rate limiting
- **Timeout Errors** → Check network connectivity

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Discovery Pipeline Performance:
- **Input:** ~11,500 stocks from Polygon API
- **Processing Time:** 2-4 seconds
- **Output:** 5-15 high-quality candidates
- **Success Rate:** ~0.07% (extremely selective)

### API Performance:
- **Health Check:** <50ms
- **Discovery Scan:** 2-4 seconds
- **Top Signals:** 2-4 seconds
- **Metrics:** <100ms

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ `/health` returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- ✅ MCP detection shows in logs
- ✅ Discovery scan returns candidates
- ✅ No errors in application logs
- ✅ Response times under 5 seconds

## 🎉 System Ready!

The enhanced discovery system is now production-ready with:
- Robust MCP integration for any deployment environment
- Real short interest data integration
- Enhanced scoring with squeeze potential
- Production-grade error handling and monitoring
- Scalable architecture ready for high-volume trading

Monitor the `/metrics` endpoint to track system performance and `/health` for system status.
