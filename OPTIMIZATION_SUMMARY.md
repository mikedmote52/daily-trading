# üéØ Daily-Trading Optimization Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Mission:** Replicate +63.8% Monthly Returns  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

---

## üìä Historical Baseline (June 1 - July 4, 2024)

**Performance:**
- Initial Capital: $1,500 (15 positions √ó $100)
- Final Value: $2,457.50
- Total Return: **+63.8%** (+$957.50)
- Win Rate: **93.3%** (14/15 profitable)

**Top Performers (Found BEFORE Explosion):**
| Stock | Return | Detection Signal | Pattern |
|-------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| VIGL | +324% | RVOL 1.8x, +0.4% price | Stealth accumulation |
| CRWV | +171% | RVOL 1.9x, -0.2% price | Institutional buying |
| AEVA | +162% | RVOL 1.7x, +1.1% price | Pre-explosion coil |

**Only Loss:** WOLF -25%

## üîç The "Magic Window" (VIGL Pattern)

**Stealth Detection Parameters:**
```python
MIN_STEALTH_RVOL = 1.5    # Minimum RVOL for accumulation
MAX_STEALTH_RVOL = 2.0    # Maximum RVOL for stealth
MAX_STEALTH_CHANGE = 2.0  # Maximum daily price change %
MIN_PRICE = 5.0           # Minimum price (avoid penny stocks)
```

**Why This Works:**
- **High Volume (1.5-2.0x RVOL)** = Institutional accumulation happening
- **Low Price Movement (<2%)** = Stealth mode (not yet discovered by public)
- **Price Floor ($5+)** = Quality stock filter
- **14-Day Pattern** = Sustained accumulation, not random spike

**Key Insight:**
VIGL, CRWV, and AEVA were all detected in this exact window BEFORE their explosive moves. The system identifies institutional accumulation happening quietly - stocks being loaded before the public catches on.

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Portfolio Structure:**
- 15 positions (equal weighting)
- $100 per position ($1,500 total)
- Position targets by accumulation score:
  - Score ‚â•80: +200% target (VIGL-like)
  - Score ‚â•70: +150% target (CRWV-like)
  - Score ‚â•60: +100% target (AEVA-like)
  - Score <60: +50% target

**Performance Targets:**
| Metric | Target | Baseline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Monthly Return | >60% | 63.8% |
| Win Rate | >90% | 93.3% |
| Max Loss/Position | <-15% | -25% (WOLF) |
| >100% Winners | ‚â•1/month | 3 (VIGL, CRWV, AEVA) |

**Risk Management:**
- Stop Loss: -15% (prevent WOLF-like losses)
- Trailing Stop: -10% from peak (lock in profits)
- Blacklist: 30-day cooloff for losers
- Current Blacklist: FATN, QMCO, QSI, NAK, PLTR, SOFI, GCCS, CDLX, CLOV, LAES

## üîí System Integrity

**Single Discovery System:**
- ‚úÖ Only ONE discovery file: `universal_discovery.py`
- ‚úÖ No duplicates (verified)
- ‚úÖ SYSTEM_LOCKED.md enforces rule

**100% Real Data:**
- ‚úÖ Template web enrichment DISABLED
- ‚úÖ Polygon API only (no mock data)
- ‚úÖ Return None on failure (no fake fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ All calculations based on real market data

**Stealth Detection:**
- ‚úÖ Constants verified (1.5-2.0x RVOL, <2% change)
- ‚úÖ 14-day sustained pattern analysis
- ‚úÖ Blacklist configured (30-day cooloff)
- ‚úÖ Premium data access (short interest, options)

## üöÄ Deployment

**Git Status:**
- ‚úÖ Commit: `5b24fc4a` - "Daily-Trading: Optimize for +63.8% monthly return replication"
- ‚úÖ Pushed to: `origin/main`
- ‚úÖ Deployment: Render auto-deploy triggered

**Expected Timeline:**
- Deployment Time: 10-15 minutes
- Monitor: https://dashboard.render.com

---

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment completes, verify:

1. **Watchlist Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://daily-trading-url/api/watchlist" | jq '.[].rvol'
   # Expected: Values between 1.5-2.0 (stealth window)
   ```

2. **No Template Data**
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://daily-trading-url/api/watchlist" | jq '.[].web_context'
   # Expected: null or None (no "Moderately bullish" generic responses)
   ```

3. **Performance Comparison**
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://daily-trading-url/performance/comparison" | jq '.comparison.grade'
   # Target: "A+" or "A"
   ```

4. **Stealth Candidates**
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://daily-trading-url/api/watchlist" | jq '.[] | {symbol, rvol, change_pct, accumulation_score}'
   # Expected: Candidates with VIGL-like patterns
   ```

## üéâ Optimization Complete

**What Changed:**
1. Documentation updated with VIGL pattern and optimization mission
2. Stealth detection constants verified (already correct)
3. Web enrichment confirmed disabled (already disabled)
4. Blacklist configured with recent losers
5. Configuration files updated with optimization parameters
6. SYSTEM_LOCKED.md created to prevent duplicate discovery files

**What Stayed the Same:**
- Core discovery algorithm (already optimized)
- API integrations (Polygon, Alpaca)
- Real data policy (already enforced)
- Single system architecture (already implemented)

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor deployment completion
2. Verify watchlist returns VIGL-pattern candidates
3. Track performance vs baseline (target: >60% monthly, >90% win rate)
4. Analyze first month results for grade (A+/A/B)

---

**Remember:** The system is already calibrated to the VIGL pattern. This optimization documented the strategy, enforced the single system rule, and configured risk management for sustainable performance.

**Target:** Beat the June-July baseline of +63.8% monthly returns with 93.3% win rate.
